#  If you are using makefile `dep-makefile.mk' to build your code and you want
#  to cross compile that code to produced executable code for the Raspberry Pi,
#  create a hidden file named '.rpi' within the source code folder to enable
#  cross compiling for the Raspberry Pi. This also enables linking with the
#  wiringPi library.

# If we're building on a computer where the directory `$(RPICROSS_BINDIR)'
# exists, assume we're cross compiling and therefore redefine make variables CC
# and CXX to use the cross C/C++ compilers and not the native C/C++ compilers.
# 
# Also, create a make variable `RPIFS' whose value is the path to the folder
# `rpifs' within the user's HOME directory on their desktop computer, which is
# presumably the folder where the RPI's file system is currently mounted.  (See
# also: man mount.rpifs).
#
# If folder $(RPICROSS_BINDIR) does not exist, assume we're building on the RPi
# itself.  In this case the make variables CC and CXX retain their original
# values and the make variable RPIFS is undefined. (n.b. The expansion of an
# undefined make variable is the null string "".)
